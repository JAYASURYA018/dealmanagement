- **If it's a folder**: `GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy`

---

### Step 2: Extract (If It's a Zip File)

**Windows**:
1. Right-click on `GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy.zip`
2. Select **"Extract All..."**
3. Choose a location (e.g., `C:\` or your Desktop)
4. Click **"Extract"**
5. Note the extraction path (e.g., `C:\GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy`)

**Mac**:
1. Double-click `GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy.zip`

**Linux**:
```bash
unzip GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy.zip -d ~/GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Package Contents

Open the extracted folder. You should see this structure:

```
GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy/
├── salesforce/
│   └── force-app/
│       └── main/
│           └── default/
│               ├── classes/
│               ├── pages/
│               ├── lwc/
│               ├── staticresources/
│               └── objects/
├── sfdx-project.json
└── VERSION.txt
```

**Important Files to Check**:
- ✅ `salesforce/force-app/main/default/staticresources/GoogleQuoteAppV2.zip` (~95 KB)
- ✅ `sfdx-project.json` (in the root folder)
- ✅ `VERSION.txt` (in the root folder)

**If any files are missing**: Contact the person who sent you the package.

---

## Deploy to Salesforce

### Step 1: Navigate to the Package Folder

In your terminal, navigate to the extracted folder.

**Windows Example**:
```powershell
cd C:\GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy
```

**Mac Example**:
```bash
cd /Users/YourName/GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy
```

**Linux Example**:
```bash
cd ~/GoogleQuoteCreation-Deploy
```

**Tip**: You can drag and drop the folder into the terminal to auto-fill the path.

---

### Step 2: Verify You're in the Right Folder

Run this command:

**Windows**:
```powershell
dir
```

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
ls
```

**Expected Output**:
You should see:
- `salesforce` (folder)
- `sfdx-project.json` (file)
- `VERSION.txt` (file)

**If you don't see these**: You're in the wrong folder. Use `cd` to navigate to the correct location.

---

### Step 3: Deploy All Components

Run this command:

```bash
sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default -o MyDevOrg
```

**What this does**:
- Deploys all Salesforce metadata to your org
- Uploads the Angular application
- Configures the backend logic
- Sets up the navigation components

**Expected Output**:
```
✔ Preparing
✔ Deploying Metadata
✔ Done

Deployed Source:
  classes/QuoteController.cls
  classes/QuoteController.cls-meta.xml
  pages/GoogleQuoteAppVF.page
  pages/GoogleQuoteAppVF.page-meta.xml
  lwc/quoteBridgeV3/quoteBridgeV3.html
  lwc/quoteBridgeV3/quoteBridgeV3.js
  lwc/quoteBridgeV3/quoteBridgeV3.js-meta.xml
  staticresources/GoogleQuoteAppV2.zip

4. Contact the person who sent you the package

**Example Error**:
```
Component Failures [1]:
  Type: ApexClass
  Name: QuoteController
  Problem: This Apex class already exists
```

**Fix**: The component already exists. You can either:

- Skip this component
- Contact your Salesforce admin

---

### Problem: "quoteBridgeV3" button not appearing

**Solution**:
1. Verify deployment was successful:
   ```bash
   sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default/lwc -o MyDevOrg
   ```
2. Refresh the page layout editor
3. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R)
4. Verify you edited the correct page layout
5. Check that the button was saved in the layout

---

### Problem: Button appears but nothing happens when clicked

**Solution**:

- Apex class not deployed
- JavaScript errors

**Solution**:
1. Verify the Opportunity has:
   - An Account relationship
   - Amount field populated
   - Close Date set
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Redeploy Apex classes:
   ```bash
   sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default/classes -o MyDevOrg
   ```

---

### Problem: Styling looks broken

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Verify static resource deployed correctly
3. Check that `GoogleQuoteAppV2.zip` is ~95 KB

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to install Angular or Node.js on my computer?

**A**: No. The Angular application is already compiled and included in the package. You only need Salesforce CLI, which requires Node.js to run, but you don't need to use Node.js directly.

---

### Q: Can I deploy this to a production org?

**A**: It's recommended to test in a sandbox first. Once verified, you can deploy to production using the same steps.

---

### Q: Will this affect my existing Salesforce data?

**A**: No. This deployment only adds new components. It doesn't modify or delete existing data.

---

### Q: Can I customize the application after deployment?

**A**: The compiled Angular app cannot be easily customized. For customizations, you would need the full source code. Contact the person who sent you the package.

---

### Q: How do I update the application if I receive a new version?

**A**: Simply repeat the deployment steps with the new package. The deployment will update the existing components.

---

### Q: Can I rename the "quoteBridgeV3" button?

**A**: Yes, but it requires editing the LWC metadata file and redeploying. It's easier to leave it as-is for now.

---

### Q: What permissions do users need to access the application?

**A**: Users need:
- Read access to Opportunities
- Read access to Accounts
- Access to the Visualforce page
- Access to the Apex class

Your Salesforce admin can configure these permissions.

---

### Q: Can I deploy individual components instead of all at once?

**A**: Yes. Use these commands:

```bash
# Apex only
sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default/classes -o MyDevOrg

# Visualforce only
sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default/pages -o MyDevOrg

# LWC only
sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default/lwc -o MyDevOrg

# Static resources only
sf project deploy start -d salesforce/force-app/main/default/staticresources -o MyDevOrg
```

---

### Q: How do I uninstall the application?

**A**: You would need to manually delete each component:
1. Delete the Apex class (QuoteController)
2. Delete the Visualforce page (GoogleQuoteAppVF)
3. Delete the LWC (quoteBridgeV3)
4. Delete the static resource (GoogleQuoteAppV2)
5. Remove the button from page layouts

---

### Q: Is this application secure?

**A**: Yes. It uses Salesforce's standard security model:
- Apex classes respect sharing rules
- User permissions are enforced
- Data is accessed through secure Salesforce APIs

---

### Q: Can multiple users use this at the same time?

**A**: Yes. The application supports concurrent users.

---

### Q: Does this work on mobile devices?

**A**: The application is optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile support may be limited.
